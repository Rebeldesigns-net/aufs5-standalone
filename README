AUFS module

Junjiro R. Okajima

In this GIT repository, there are several GIT branches named "aufsX.Y".
Here "X.Y" is the version number and it corresponds to the linux version
(aufs3 and later). Run git-checkout to get the source files of aufs.

For instance, when you are using aufs5.0 (which means your system is
linux-v5.0), you should run
	$ git checkout origin/aufs5.0
in this direcotry and you can get the source files for aufs5.0.
To compile and install them, read the README file after "git checkout".

Enjoy!
